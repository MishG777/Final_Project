            <p>
              My job in UFC started in August 2021, it's really exciting
              experience for me, In 2020 I was in GIS - Georgian Integrated
              Systems as an android Developer, but soon I guess that it's not
              suitable for me, lets talk a little about my company: It's a first
              Georgian Processing Center established in January 1996, serving 25

              company's objective is to offer sustainable, flexible, and secure
              innovative payment tools to clients and partners through
              high-tech, internationally-certified services. I'm tring to learn
              more and more to do my best and be more productive in future and
